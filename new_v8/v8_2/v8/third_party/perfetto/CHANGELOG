    * Added cmdline arguments for integration within ChromeOS system image
      (--{producer,consumer}-socket-{group,mode} for chmod-ing sockets).
    * Changed path lookup logic for traced socket. /run/perfetto/ is used if the
      directory exists, falling back on /tmp/ otherwise.
    * Added support for kernel frame symbolization to the traced_perf callstack
      sampler.
    * Added support for resolving ftrace event arguments that require
      symbolization against printk_format.

      page in the UI.

  Tracing service and probes:
    * Added support for recording traces from a system service through the
      client API.

      connection to the tracing service is lost. Also fixed crashes in ongoing
      tracing sessions when a disconnect occurs.

    * Enabled commit batching and producer side patching of chunks.
    * Add support for symbolizing kernel symbols for ftrace events.
  Trace Processor:
    * Fixed type affinity of string columns.

      pressing 'm' marks the range.
    * Added initial support for displaying flow event arrows.
    * Improved ordering of all thread tracks under process grouping.
    * Fixed UI crashes due to metric errors
    * Fixed selection of thread state slices.


v7.0 - 2020-09-01:
  Tracing service and probes:
    * Added auto-reconnection to the SDK. Tracing::Initialize() now retries in
      the background, instead of failing, if the tracing service is unrechable.
    * Added support for recording cpuhp (CPU hotplug) ftrace events.
    * Fixed heap profiling unwinding on multi-ABI systems.
    * Fixed reporting of live objects in the native heap profiler when using

      the UI and the Chrome extension is installed.
  Misc:
    * Update language to comply with Android's inclusive language guidance.

    * Fixed filtering out of stale ftrace data that predates the beginning of
      the tracing session.

      symbol files by build id rather than name.
    * Added screen-state Android metrics.
