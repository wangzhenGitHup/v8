Description: Markdown for C
 MD4C is C Markdown parser with the following features:
 .
 Compliance: Generally MD4C aims to be compliant to the latest version of
 CommonMark specification. Right now fully compliant to CommonMark 0.28.
 .
 Extensions: MD4C supports some commonly requested and accepted extensions.
 .
 Compactness: MD4C is implemented in one source file and one header file.
 .
 Embedding: MD4C is easy to reuse in other projects, its API is very
 straightforward: There is actually just one function, md_parse().
 .
 Push model: MD4C parses the complete document and calls callback functions
 provided by the application for each start/end of block, start/end of a span,
 and with any textual contents.
 .
 Portability: MD4C builds and works on Windows and Linux, and it should
 be fairly simple to make it run also on most other systems.
 .
 Encoding: MD4C can be compiled to recognize ASCII-only control characters,
 UTF-8 and, on Windows, also UTF-16, i.e. what is on Windows commonly
 called just "Unicode". See more details below.
 .
 Permissive license: MD4C is available under the MIT license.
