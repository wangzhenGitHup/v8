/*
 * The EBR-safe Radix tree assumes tree traversing without any
 * blocking synchronization. Only EBR guards should be used
 * on readers side to prevent reclamation of currently visible
 * nodes.
 * Updates should be done using blocking synchronization such
 * as lock, mutexes and etc. Updates are non-destructive for
 * concurrent readers, readers can perfectly run in parallel
 * with any updater, but concurrent updates without proper
 * synchronization are prohibited and can lead to inconsistency
 * in Radix tree or even to application crash.
 * Here is the list of functions that can be safely used on
 * readers side, protected only by EBR guards:
 *
 * ebr_radix_tree_is_empty()
 * ebr_radix_tree_find_item()
 * ebr_radix_tree_get_next()
 * ebr_radix_tree_find_items()
 * ebr_radix_tree_find_tagged_items()
 * ebr_radix_tree_tagged()
 * ebr_radix_tree_tag_test()
 *
 * The caller must ensure that these functions are called
 * under EBR guards. If so, any modifications of the tree
 * can be done concurrently with these functions execution.
 * These functions doesn't guarantee data consistency for
 * tree items. It is assumed that items should have own
 * synchronization to provide data consistency for them.
 *
 * Notes:
 * The result of ebr_radix_tree_tagged(),
 * ebr_radix_tree_tag_test(), ebr_radix_tree_find_tagged_items()
 * may be affected by concurrent tags modifications.
 * The ebr_radix_tree_find_items() and ebr_radix_tree_find_tagged_items()
 * doesn't provide an atomic snapshot of the tree. The result may be
 * affected by functions that modify tree tags or functions that delete
 * tree items. These functions are implemented in a way when multiple
 * lookups with individual locks are performed to search items.
 * The ebr_radix_tree_for_each() and ebr_radix_tree_for_each_tagged()
 * implemented in the same way as ebr_radix_tree_find_items() and
 * ebr_radix_tree_find_tagged_items() and can restart lookup from
 * the tree root in case of index reached node boundary.
 *
 * For all EBR-safe functions concurrently inserted items can be
 * missed in lookup. This is expected due to this is the same story
 * as in case when lookup under lock is executed before insertion and
 * newly inserted item was not observed.

/*
 * Initialization macro of ebr-safe radix tree,
 * must take an epoch set as parameter.
