	-------------
	Lock guard
	-------------

	A lock guard is an object that manages a mutex object by keeping it always
	locked.

	On construction, the mutex object is locked by the calling thread, and on
	destruction, the mutex is unlocked. It is the simplest lock, and is specially
	useful as an object with automatic duration that lasts until the end of its
	context.

	In this way, it guarantees the mutex object is properly unlocked in error case,
	which make us create more readable error handling.

	Note though that the lock_guard object does not manage the lifetime of the
	mutex object in any way: the duration of the mutex object shall extend at least
	until the destruction of the lock_guard that locks it.

	NOTE: most of above texts are copied from:

	For usage, see test__sysmgr_mutex_guard()
